# Mission statement

The **International Workshop on Learning, Memory, and Attention (III)** is
a collaborative research initiative for developing integrative
approaches to understanding relationships between learning, memory, and
attention processes. 

The workshop will consist of paper sessions
delivered over the course of a week.  One of the intended outcomes of
the workshop is the establishment of an international training network
that will foster shared training of graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows among participating laboratories in Canada (McMaster
University, University of Manitoba), United States (Brooklyn College of the City University of New York),
and Spain (Universidad de Granada, Universidad de Santiago de
Compostela).
